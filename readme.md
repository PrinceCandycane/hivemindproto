# Hivemind Prototype

This is a prototype to expand and prove the ideas behind the mechanics of "Hivemind" (working title). The game is an RTS focused on the crowd-dynamics of a hivemind based society. Players must keep control of their hive while constructing and building to disrupt and destroy the other colonies. Spacing, resource management, and map control are key to winning this RTS.
